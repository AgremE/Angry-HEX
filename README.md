Angry-HEX is an artificial player for the popular video game Angry Birds; it participated in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 [Angry Birds AI Competition](http://aibirds.org).

The agent is based on declarative knowledge bases, and features a combination of traditional imperative programming and declarative programming that allows to achieve high flexibility in strategy design and knowledge modelling. In particular, it relies on the use of *Answer Set Programming* (*ASP*) and [*HEX programs*](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/systems/dlvhex).

*Logic programming* is used for decision tasks such as which target to hit at each shot (*tactic gameplay*) or which level to play at each turn, and which way (*strategic gameplay*).
