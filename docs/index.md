Angry-HEX is a joint development of groups at Università della Calabria ([UNICAL](http://www.mat.unical.it)), Technische Universität Wien ([TUWIEN](http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at)), Marmara University ([MARMARA](http://www.knowlp.com)), and Max Planck Institut für Informatik ([MPI](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/)).

A distinctive characteristic of our agent is that it uses a declarative, logic programming based module for reasoning about the target to shoot at next.
It is realized as a so-called _HEX-program_, i.e., by means of Answer Set Programming (ASP) with external sources and other extensions.
